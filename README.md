# xFolio - Social Sharing for Artists and Creatives

Deployed App: [Deployed on Heroku](https://xfolio-beta.herokuapp.com)

### Why?

There is a distinct lack of space for artists and creatives to share their work, be it totally sfw, dark, disturbing, or erotic. As artists ourselves we feel that lack deeply. While there are sites where artists can share their work and make connections they are all ages platforms with many restrictions on content. Which makes them ill suited for the large and prolific world of art and content for adults.

### Isn't that just a nice way of saying "we allow porn"?

Yes and no. Adult content isn't only porn, though labeling something as "porn" is often meant to dismiss the work as unimportant, only for (sinful) pleasure and therefore of no value. There's very real demand for a site that allows for adult content made by adults for adults, be that gorey horror, queer erotica, furry fetish content, or raunchy fanart. Artists who deal with dark and/or erotic themes deserve to have a place where they can share their work knowing the audience is mature enough to handle dark/erotic content and have opted in to the experience. 

### Implemented Features:
* Artwork marked 'nsfw' in the tags will be hidden from users who aren't logged in
* Gallery filtering via tags
* Custom portfolio page to show off your best works by tagging them with 'portfolio' 
* Gallery, Portfolio, and Blog pages for all registered users that can easily be shared via links

### Future Features:
* Filtering on blog content (for the writers out there)
* Paywall posts so you can monetize your work, or add the extra layer of paywall protection on your mature art
* Comments and likes on all posts
* User can choose who sees their work either though lists of 'allowed users' or other means
* Flagging innapropriate posts (such as illegal content, harassment, or hate speach)
* So much more!
